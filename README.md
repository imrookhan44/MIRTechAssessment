## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nextjs-crm.git
cd nextjs-crm
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Project Structure

```
- components/
  - ClientList.tsx
  - ClientDetails.tsx
  - ClientForm.tsx
- pages/
  - index.tsx
  - clients/
    - [id].tsx
- types/
  - Client.ts
```

Brief description of each folder:

- `components/`: React components used in the application.
- `pages/`: Next.js pages for routing.
- `types/`: TypeScript types or interfaces.

## Usage

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

## Optimization Strategies

- **Bundle Size Optimization:** Use Next.js built-in code splitting, analyze with `webpack-bundle-analyzer`, and lazy load components.
- **Image Optimization:** Optimize and compress images; use Next.js Image component.
- **SSR vs. SSG:** Choose based on content nature and performance requirements.

## Libraries

- **Styling:** `styled-components` for modular styles.
- **Form Handling:** `Formik` for efficient form management.
- **State Management:** React's built-in state for simpler apps; consider `Redux` or `React Query` for complex state.

## Code Splitting

Use dynamic imports for code splitting:

```tsx
// pages/clients/[id].tsx

import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';
const ClientDetails = dynamic(() => import('../../components/ClientDetails'));
```
